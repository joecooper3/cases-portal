# CASES Portal

This is a Wordpress theme in development for [CASES](https://www.cases.org) as an internal operations portal. Its contents include a staff directory and pertinent information about our different programs. Program managers and heads of departments should be able to add resources to their individual pages as they see fit.

## Okay, let me explainâ€¦

You're free to poke around, but this isn't really for public distribution. I didn't include the CSV with all of CASES' employee data on a public repository, so the entire application won't really work. This is really just up for version control reasons.

Maybe one day I'll include a ton of dummy data based on the Cheers/Frasier universe, but for now you can probably move along.

## Built With

* [underscores](https://underscores.me/) - minimalist starter Wordpress theme
* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
